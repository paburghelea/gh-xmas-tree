Grasshopper Christmas Tree

This is a simplified Christmas tree created using Grasshopper 1.0.007 and Rhinoceros 3D. It was produced to be used as a simple and fun script example during the Christamss vacation. It shows some of the best practices for developing Grasshopper definitions, such as:
- 'Clusterisation' for repetitive batteries
- Avoiding dependecies to third-party libraries, where possible
- No more than 1 level deep clusters
- Organising inputs to the left and outputs to the right of the canvas

All geometry is internalised and there are no third-party library dependencies besides Human for nicer lines using [Custom Preview Lineweights](https://grasshopperdocs.com/components/human/customPreviewLineweights.html)!

To run you just need to drag and drop the definition in your canvas. Feel free to explore the definition!
